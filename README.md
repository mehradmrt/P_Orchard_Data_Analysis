# Machine Learning Pipeline For Water Status Detection in Orchards

## Description

This repository provides a comprehensive machine learning pipeline for water status detection in orchards, leveraging classification and regression algorithms to predict Stem Water Potential. The project consists of three main modules: data mining, data cleaning, and data analysis. These modules are aimed to analyze weather and drone imaging metadata to provide data-driven models for precise water status prediction. 

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies for ML analysis.

```sh
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn scipy
```
